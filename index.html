            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </aside>
        <p>Originally from Colorado, I always have to clarify that I didn't grow up in the mountains, but rather, the plains. That said, I think I've always been a New York at heart -- I told my mom, at the ripe old age of twelve, that I'd be a New Yorker one day.</p>
        <p>Well, now I've lived in the city for about a decade, most of that time being spent in Manhattan. Some of my favorite activities include traveling, trying new restaurants, and passing time time playing Fortnite. (Yes, I know most of my peers on the game are pre-teens. Many of them are better than me!) I built this page to highlight my journey to becoming a software engineer. Below you'll find a grouping of the projects that I've completed during my time in the Columbia Software Engineering program. If you'd like to learn more, or generally connect, reach out below!</p>
